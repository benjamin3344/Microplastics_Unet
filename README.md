# Microplastics_UNet: Automatic quantification and classification of microplastics in scanning electron micrographs via deep learning. 

This repository shared the source code for the paper *"Automatic quantification and classification of microplastics in scanning electron micrographs via deep learning"* published in the journal 
Science of the Total Environment. Four models were adapted for microplastics semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and shape classification.  Codes were adapted from the following repositories:

- U-Net: [https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet](https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet) semantic segmentation
- MultiResUNet: [https://github.com/nibtehaz/MultiResUNet](https://github.com/nibtehaz/MultiResUNet) semantic segmentation
- VGG-16: [https://github.com/sajadn/Exemplar-VAE](https://github.com/sajadn/Exemplar-VAE) shape classification
- Pixel-embedding UNet: [https://github.com/looooongChen/instance_segmentation_with_pixel_embeddings](https://github.com/looooongChen/instance_segmentation_with_pixel_embeddings) instance segmentation

## Requirements
- python 3.6
- tensorflow_gpu 1.14.1
- please check example_scripts for other libraries


## Data

A manually labelled SEM dataset of microplastics was built. Image segmentation and shape classification were performed on 3 classes: fibres,
beads and fragments as shown in the paper [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153903](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153903). Datasets were uploaded to Mendeley Data [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/z6459vntbr/1](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/z6459vntbr/1) (will soon be updated to https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/z6459vntbr/2)
